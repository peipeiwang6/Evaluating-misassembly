> reorder the mapped reads

> transfer sam file to bam file

 - samtools view -bS 02_SRR404081_reorder.sam -o 03_SRR404081_reorder.bam

> ## Step 02: Determine the optimal bin size. Note that bin sizes of 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 bp have been tested

> Determine read depth and regions with variable read coverage using CNVnator (Abyzov et al., 2011) with different bin sizes. Note that in outputs of CNVnator, regions with significantly higher (HC) is referred to as "duplication", while regions with significanly lower (LC) read coverages is "deletion". The remain regions were taken as BG.

 - cnvnator -genome Solanum_lycopersicum_GCF_000188115.3_SL2.50_genomic.fa -root Sly.root -call bin_size > Sly.cnv

> Determine the optimal bin size. The optimal bin size was the bin size leading to a ratio of RD average to RD standard deviation of ~4-5 as suggested (Abyzov et al., 2011)

 - cnvnator -root my.root -his bin_size -d genome/

 - cnvnator -root my.root -eval bin_size > out_put

> ## Step 03: save the read depth (RD) in each bin region to a file

 - awk '{print $2}END{print "exit"}' Sly.cnv | cnvnator -root Sly.root -genotype bin_size > out_put
 
> ## Step 04: resample reads based on different strategies

Reads were resampled based on simulated RDs: i) the only possible RD values were 0 (LC), 1 (BG), or 2 (HC) regions; ii) the analysisoriginal RD values were discretized (rounded) to their closest integers; iii) the analysis RD were used; iiii) the analysis RD but resampled at X-fold coverage.

> ## Step 05: HC/LC designation filtering

Adjust p-values (q-value), then filter HC/LC regions based on q-value and q0 value. Before that, q-value threshold was determined by evaluating the consistency between results using original reads and resampled reads. 

 - R --vanilla --slave --args input_file output_file < 05_01_pvalue_adjustment.r  ### Note that the input_file is the Sly.cnv resulted from CNVnator

 - python 05_03_draw_F1_at_different_qvalues.py 

> ## Step 06: Determine HC/LC/BG regions with high confidence

Compare RD in HC, LC, and BG regions, then determine the threshold to call HC/LC/BG regions with high confidence.

 - R --vanilla --slave --args RD_from_CNVnator HC_LC_designation_from_CNVnator HC_LC_designation_from_CNVnator_after_filtering output_HC output_BG output_LC < 06_threshold_to_distinguishing_HC_LC_BG_regions.r
 
> ## Step 07: Accuracy and precision of HC/LC/BG calling

To evaluate the accuracy and precision of HC/LC/BG calling, resample reads from genome with simulated RDs, and rerun CNVnator again and compare the original RDs (anslysis RDs) with the new RD. The simulated RDs are: i) the only possible RD values were 0 (LC), 1 (BG), or 2 (HC) regions; ii) the analysisoriginal RD values were discretized (rounded) to their closest integers; iii) the analysis RD were used.
          
> ## Step 08: Impact of read coverage on RD determination

To assess the extent to which read coverage impacts the RD determination, reads at 5-fold, 10-fold, 20-fold and 30-fold coverages were resampled from dataset2, and were used to rerun CNVnator.

** Density of genes **

** K-mer **

** Tandem repeats, or Simple sequence repeat **


> ## Step 10: Build prediction models using Random Forest

> ## Step 11: Get importance value of each feature in the prediction models
  
 - python 11_tree-based_FS.py your_dataset your_classes_list

> ## Step 12: Select K-mer and SSR features based on p-value of Kruskal-Wallis H test

> ## Step 13: Determine the correlation between densities of HC/LC/BG regions with densities of genome features.

 - python 13_density_across_genome.py  ### input files see notes in the script
 
> ## Step 14: Estimate the prevalence of HC/LC/BG across the genome

To assess how the observed correlation between densities of HC/LC/BG regions with densities of genome features derived from random expectation, HC/LC/BG regions were reshuffled across the genome 1000 times, where HC/LC/BG regions don't overlap with each other.

 - python 14_02_density_of_reshuffled_HC_LC_BG_in_500Kb.py Length_of_chromosomes correlation_NCBI_SGN path_to_files 

> ## Step 15: Estimate gene proproties located in HC regions

To evaluate the properties of genes located in HC regions, first the number of each type of gene overlapping with HC regions were determined. Next, regions with same number and length of HC regions were randomly selected from BG regions, which was repeat 10,000 times. The observed numbers of genes were compared with the random null distribution to see which type of gene is over- or under-representative.
